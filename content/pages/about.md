Hi, I'm ecommerce evangelist / developer for Imagination Media. I'm responsible for lead the team to building innovator products and improve the workflow strategy.

My passion building software and sharing knowledge brought me to speak in over 14 conferences and create 21 projects used for more than 20,000 developers in the world. Now, I'm focused on bringing innovation to the e-commerce ecosystem using the Magento 2 platform.
