## Career

My main focus is to work with companies that I can acquire knowledge and develops my ability to learn, be efficient and promotes encouragement and opportunity to grow within the company.

Always worked in companies that captivate me the knowledge I can acquire and by living with great people, I consider each project I participate in as something special that deserves my full dedication, then follow cherish since its creation, development, finalization and soon after the customer loyalty for a job well done and completed term.

For me, career success must be built on a foundation of extensive knowledge and solid fitness on teamwork, respect, ambition, humility and above all professionalism.
